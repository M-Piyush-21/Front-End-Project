// What is jsconfig.json?
// It is a configuration file for JavaScript projects, mainly used by VS Code to enable better IntelliSense, auto-imports, and module resolution.
// It helps VS Code understand how your project is structured.

// "compilerOptions" → Settings that tell VS Code how to handle JavaScript.
//  "moduleResolution": "node" →
// This makes sure VS Code resolves (finds) modules like Node.js does.
// It allows you to use import something from "package" without issues.
// "include": ["src"] →
// This tells VS Code "Only look at files inside the src folder" for suggestions, IntelliSense, and errors.
// Other folders (like node_modules) are ignored.
